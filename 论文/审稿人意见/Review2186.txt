Nowadays RUL Prognostics of device is a hot issue in engineering field. The authors propose an improved LSTM method with real-time parameters updating by using new online observation data to minimize the cost function. The method is applied to predict the remaining useful life of NASA lithium-ion battery, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed ILSTM in RUL Prognostics of device. The organization of the manuscript is quite good but there may exist some typo error. Please check if there is a typo in figure 4.
