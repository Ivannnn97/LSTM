An improved long and short term memory neural network (LSTM) method is proposed for the problem that the traditional LSTM model can not effectively use the non-life-cycle data to establish an excellent RUL Prognostics model and the inability to utilize the online data reasonably. It is a novel idea and have been validated experimentally. The only thing that is not perfect is the analysis of experiment results should be clearly stated. Furthermore, it is better to add some information on the experiment of the proposed method. In conclusion, this paper has a clear idea and good simulation results, only the section 4 needs to be improved.
